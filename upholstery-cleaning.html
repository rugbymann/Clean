    <h3>
        Clean and well-maintained furniture is one of the main adornments of every home. <br>However, initial
        cleanliness cannot be maintained indefinitely.
        <br>If upholstered furniture is not taken care of, it quickly becomes soiled and eventually deteriorates over
        time.
        <br>Regular vacuuming cannot eliminate the large amount of dust that accumulates deep within upholstered
        furniture, as well as saprophytic mites and microorganisms.


        Furthermore, furniture dry cleaning will rid you of stains that have accidentally found their way onto the
        surface.
        <br>Upholstery dry cleaning is performed by experienced specialists and involves a set of procedures that allow
        for achieving perfectly clean upholstered furniture as the end result.
        Our company utilizes the most modern equipment and water-based chemical substances that are completely harmless
        to the human body.
